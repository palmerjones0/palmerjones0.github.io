What’s the best airport you’ve ever visited? I recently had the pleasure of departing from **Texarkana Regional Airport (TXK)**, a small airport that recently received a [major upgrade](https://flytxk.com/travelers/new-texarkana-regional-airport-terminal/) in 2024. What TXK lacks in connectivity — currently only 2 daily flights to DFW — it more than makes up for in tranquility and accessibility!

## Parking and Transportation
Unlike most larger airports, TXK’s parking, passenger drop off, and car rentals are conveniently just steps from the terminal. Don’t miss the water feature!
### Passenger Drop Off
I doubt you’ll ever hear honking or need to circle the building while waiting for passengers to arrive here!

### Parking
If you aren’t lucky enough to have a friend or family member drop you off, fear not! TXK has covered and uncovered parking available for only $XX.

### Car Rentals
TXK is served by Budget, Avis, and Dollar car rentals. No need to worry about catching a shuttle, the rental lot is adjacent to parking.

## Ground-Side Terminal
Whether departing or arriving, passengers will surely enjoy the clean, tastefully designed terminal building. Combined with the absence of garish advertisements and friendly service at airline/car rental check in counters, the atmosphere is comfortable, quiet, and relaxed.
Security opens up about 90 minutes before scheduled flights, and took me about 10 minutes the day I was there. Make sure not to cut anyone in line, there’s a good chance you’ll be seated by them on your flight!

## Air-Side Terminal
Once through security, a short escalator ride takes you up to the departure gates. I would wager this is one of the only escalators in Texarkana! There is also an elevator available. Upon reaching the top, you’re greeted by a dramatic illustration of one of Texarkana’s most interesting features. If you hadn’t guessed by the name, Texarkana lies squarely on the Texas-Arkansas border. The local post office (pictured) is split down the middle by the border… sounds like a beuracratic nightmare!
TXK’s **two gates** share an appropriately-sized waiting area equipped with **reclined seating, free WiFi, and plenty of power outlets**. Additionally, around the corner there’s a more casual lounge area with well-stocked vending machines. Floor-to-ceiling windows spanning the entire gate area give an expansive view of the airport’s primary runway and FBO across the way. I watched as the American Airlines CRJ-900 I would be taking to DFW landed and quickly taxied to the gate. As we pushed back from the gate, our pilot sarcastically quipped that we were first in like for takeoff!

## Destinations
Currently, TXK is only served by **twice-daily service to DFW** operated by American Airlines affiliate American Eagle. As recently as 2022 United maintained service to [Houston](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/jul/10/united-airlines-pulls-out-of-texarkana-airport/#:~:text=July%2010%2C%202022%20at%201%3A01%20a.m.&text=TEXARKANA%20%2D%2D%20After%20five%20months,6.), hopefully that will be resumed in the near future.

## Conclusion
If you find yourself visiting the TX/AR/LA/OK quad state area consider flying into Texarkana Regional! While TXK may not have the glitz and glam of larger airports, you’ll certainly be charmed by the friendly service and convenience of this small airport.
