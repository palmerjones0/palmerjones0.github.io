DeepSeek has recently gained attention for its AI models that rival industry leaders like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This post, inspired by [Computerphile’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4Z-9QlZ64), breaks down what makes DeepSeek unique in a minute or less.

### Doing More with Less
DeepSeek’s V3 model claims to deliver performance similar to ChatGPT-4o while using only **$5 million** in hardware and electricity, far less than the rumored **$100 million** spent by some competitors. The energy demand for AI is so high that some companies are even considering [nuclear reactors](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/28/why-microsoft-amazon-google-and-meta-are-betting-on-nuclear-power.html) to power their data centers.

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
The key innovation behind DeepSeek’s efficiency is its use of **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**. Unlike a single massive model handling all tasks, MoE uses **specialized smaller models**, making it far more efficient while maintaining high performance.

### Chain of Thought for Complex Reasoning
DeepSeek’s **R1 model** employs **Chain of Thought (CoT)** reasoning, helping it tackle multi-step problems more effectively. This is similar to OpenAI’s o1 model, enabling better logical processing compared to base AI models.

### Open Source Advantage
Unlike OpenAI’s models, DeepSeek is **open source**, meaning anyone can [download](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) and experiment with it. This transparency allows developers to explore its capabilities freely.

### The Caveats
Despite its promising claims, there’s skepticism about DeepSeek’s actual efficiency and performance. Still, the results have been promising enough to **deflate the US tech market**. Also worth keeping in mind, as a **Chinese company**, DeepSeek operates under **government censorship**, which may limit its access to certain information and influence its outputs.

### Final Thoughts
DeepSeek’s advancements in AI efficiency and openness are exciting, but questions remain about its true performance and potential limitations. What do you think?
