When diving into the world of artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs), you'll encounter many terms that seem intimidating at first. Here’s a quick, jargon-free guide to some of the most common terms.

### LLM (Large Language Model)

An LLM is an AI that's read and learned from vast amounts of text and can predict what words come next in a sentence. Think of it as the world's most advanced autocomplete tool—like the predictive text feature on your phone but infinitely smarter.

### Neural Network

This is the technology behind LLMs—a network of artificial "neurons" inspired by the human brain. Each neuron performs simple calculations, and together, they handle complex tasks, similar to how teams in a company each handle specific roles to achieve big goals.

### Parameters

Parameters are essentially the adjustable knobs or switches within a neural network that the model tunes during training to learn from data. The more parameters, the smarter and more capable the model typically is—just like a spreadsheet with millions of adjustable cells.

### Temperature

Temperature in LLMs controls how creative or predictable the model’s responses will be. A low temperature (close to 0) makes the AI more conservative and precise, while a higher temperature (closer to 1 or more) produces more diverse, imaginative responses. Think of it as choosing between following a strict recipe or improvising with whatever you have in your kitchen.

### Prompt

A prompt is simply the input you provide to an AI to guide its response. It's like asking a clear question or giving specific instructions to someone to get exactly what you need.

### Tokens

Tokens are chunks of words or characters processed by an AI. They're like individual puzzle pieces the model assembles to form coherent sentences and paragraphs. Longer prompts or responses require more tokens.

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning means taking a general-purpose AI and teaching it further on specific topics or tasks with specialized data. Imagine hiring an employee with general skills and training them specifically for your business's unique needs.

### Embeddings

Embeddings turn words and sentences into mathematical representations, allowing AI to understand relationships between words. Think of them as coordinates on a map, placing related concepts close together and unrelated ones further apart.

### Hallucination

Hallucination occurs when an AI confidently gives incorrect or nonsensical information. Imagine asking a confident colleague for directions, only to later realize they had no idea and just guessed convincingly.

### Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

RLHF means humans guide the AI’s learning by rating its responses, teaching the AI to better match human expectations. It’s like training a new employee by giving regular feedback on their work to improve over time.

### Context Window

The context window is how much recent conversation or instruction the model can "remember" when generating responses. It’s similar to your working memory—there’s only so much you can keep track of at once before you have to reference notes or past conversations.

Understanding these common terms can help you engage more confidently and productively with AI technologies in business discussions or strategic decisions.
