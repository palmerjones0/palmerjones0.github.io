Following up from my previous post about [making a stl file from a geographical feature](/blog/pinnacle-mountain-tif-to-stl/), I wanted to give an update on the project. See the final result and the steps I followed to make the 3D file a reality! A special thanks to [Andrew](andrew@apex3dprints.com) at [Apex 3D Prints](https://www.apex3dprints.com) for helping make this a reality!

## Editing in Blender
I wanted the print to fit inside of a snow globe, so I **trimmed the perimeter** of the print down so it would have a circular base. Also, to allow the snow globe to be filled with water, I **punched a hole in the bottom** to align with the hole in my snow globe base.

## Repairing the File
I had a lot of **issues with invalid geometry** in my file, probably because the level of detail is so high in this model. To avoid having to manually fix hundreds of these errors, I found an **online tool** that did a great job of fixing these automatically. [FormWare](https://formware.co/OnlineStlRepair) was really quick and easy to use in a browser, I recommend giving it a try!

## 3D Printing
Instead of using a large, national 3D printing services can be expensive for small projects like this one. [Apex 3D Prints](https://www.apex3dprints.com) is fast, local to the RDU area, and has great customer serivice. Additionally, Andrew was able to talk me through the best finish options for my project. Since I intended to paint this print, a **primer** layer was the best choice.

## Paint and Varnish
Since I already had some **acrylic paints** around the house, I used those to paint the primed print. After the paint dried, I sprayed on a **matte varnish**, which greatly improved the look of the final product.

## Summary
This was a really fun project, I'm looking forward to more 3D printing projects in the future. If you have ideas, let me know in the comments!
