I wanted to use the first post as a way to share how I set up this site. I was able to host this static site for an average cost less than $1/month.

## Choosing a Hosting Platform
This site is a personal project that I don’t expect to produce any income, so my emphasis first and foremost was to choose a hosting option that is low-cost. From my research, the two main contenders in this category are GitHub Pages and WordPress. I decided to use GitHub Pages because it is completely free to host a public site, whereas it seemed like anything beyond the most basic WordPress site would incur a monthly fee in the $3-$30 range. Also, I think GitHub Pages is much better suited for building coding skills and showing off programming projects, and overall allows more control while still being simple enough for a novice like me. I’ll go into more detail later, but the main skills you’ll need to get up and running are a basic familiarity with git and some general knowledge on formatting with Markdown. GitHub Pages will translate your Markdown formatting into static html via a simple tool called Jekyll. More on that later.

## My Custom Domain
While hosting on GitHub Pages is free, your domain name will be INSERT HERE unless you acquire and connect a custom .com domain name. For me, I really wanted to have a custom domain for the site. I researched domain name providers and settled on PorkBun, where I was able to purchase the palmercjones.com domain on a multi-year contract for an average cost of just under $1 per month. I have had a great experience with PorkBun thus far, and they made the process of connecting my domain to my GitHub Pages site incredibly easy. I’ll go into more detail on how to configure your domain further down in this post, but if you have decided to stick to the default GitHub Pages domain then you can skip the steps about configuring the host.
