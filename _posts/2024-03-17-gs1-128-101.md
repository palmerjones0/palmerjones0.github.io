These days, almost everyone has experience with simple barcodes. Whether for labelling items at a grocery store or identifying the tracking number on packages, you probably see barcodes every day. But, most don't know that there is a specific barcode standard that is been widely-used in distribution, and is being increasingly adoped in manufacturing. Let's take a look at the basics of the GS1-128 barcode standard.

## Encoding Information
One of the main factors that makes GS1-128 barcodes so useful is the ability to **encode multiple pieces of information into one barcode**. To encode the information in a modular way GS1-128 barcodes use a system of **fixed/variable length strings** and **application identifiers**.

### Application Identifiers
Application identifiers (AIs) are used to show what pieces of information is about to be shared. These are laid out by the GS1 organization [here](https://ref.gs1.org/ai/). You'll often see these **2-4 digit numbers represented in parentheses**. For example, in a barcode that reads (10)000451*FNC1*(15)240401(3102)002319 there are three AIs: (10) Lot number, (15) Best By Date, and (3102) weight in kg with 2 decimal places. By scanning this one barcode, we know that this item was in Lot 451, had a best by date of April 1st, 2024, and weights 23.19kg.
### Fixed Length vs Variable Length
You may have noticed in the example above that there was a special FNC1 inserted after the Lot number. This was necessary because unlike the fixed-length Best By Date and the weight, the Lot number is a variable-length attribute. Since we don't know how many characters will be in the Lot number, we need to use the special FNC1 character to signify the end.
>The FNC1 character can be represented many different ways in code, if you're writing a program that reads barcodes you may need to read the documentation of your specific programming language

## GTINs and Company Prefixes
Besides providing a standard way to encode information, the GS1-128 standard also allows for easy encoding on GTINs and Company Prefixes for labelling finished products. Both are encoded with the (01) application identifier. The GS1 organization maintains and distributes all GTINs and Company Prefixes, which can be purchased through their [website](https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode).
### GTIN
A GTIN is a Global Trade Identification Number. This 12-14 digit number is a unique number that speficies an individual product or SKU. Many small and medium companies opt for a GTIN if they only have a handful of products they need to identify since they start at only $30 each.
### Company Prefix
Companies that utilize thousands of distinct SKUs may find it better to purchase a company prefix for $2,100. This prefix allows companies to reserve a bulk section of GTINs cost-effectively. When a seller or distributor scans the barcode downstream, they'll instantly know what company the labelled item came from.

## Conclusion
GS1-128 barcodes are a popular, reliable, and effecient way convey multiple attributes in one simple barcode. While they have been mostly limited to the distribution industry in the past, they are gaining popularity in other industries because of their flexibility and completeness.
