The 2024 elections showcased the importance of **strategic voting**, where voters often prioritize a candidate’s electability over their own preferences. A prominent example was the relatively popular third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who withdrew *himself* from the presidential race. RFK, polling as high as [15%](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/07/11/the-presidential-choice-biden-trump-kennedy/) in July, was still at [3%](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/07/11/the-presidential-choice-biden-trump-kennedy/) when he dropped out in August. His exit was seen as an effort to consolidate conservative support behind Donald Trump ([Northestern](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/rfk-jr-drops-out-endorses-donald-trump-former-president-may-get-small-bump-expert-says/)), who later [nominated](https://abcnews.go.com/US/rfk-jr-nominated-hhs-secretary-agencies-overse/story?id=115894410) him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

## The Voting Landscape Today
Under the **Plurality Voting** system, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority (over 50%). This system, also known as First Past the Post, encourages voters to support candidates who already have significant backing, often from major parties. While political parties aren't part of the Constitution—famously criticized in Washington's [farewell address](https://www.mountvernon.org/education/primary-source-collections/primary-source-collections/article/washington-s-farewell-address-1796)—they naturally arose to consolidate voter support.
In my view, this system limits voter choice, reduces accountability, and discourages elected officials from addressing issues effectively, as maintaining unsolved problems can continue to give them issues to campaign on.

## How Ranked Choice Voting Works
In Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), voters **rank** candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority (over 50%) on the first count, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Votes for the eliminated candidate are redistributed to their voters' next choice. This process continues until a candidate earns a majority.
<br><br>
Let’s use a hypothetical scenario from Alaska’s 2024 presidential election, where Ranked Choice Voting is used. Imagine the first-round results were: Trump with 45%, Harris with 40%, and RFK with 15%. Since no candidate earned over 50%, RFK would be eliminated, and his voters’ second-choice preferences would be redistributed. If two-thirds of RFK’s voters chose Trump as their next preference, he would gain an additional 10%, bringing the final totals to Trump with 55% and Harris with 45%.

## Why it Matters
So if we end up with the same result anyway, what makes Ranked Choice voting better? Ranked Choice Voting offers multiple advantages. Supporters of less popular candidates can still **make their voices heard**, leading to a **more accurate representation** of voter priorities. Over time, this can make it easier for **third-party** or **independent** candidates to succeed, fostering greater diversity in political leadership. Additionally, by allowing **same-party challengers** to compete more fairly, RCV **motivates incumbents to remain effective**. Studies show that RCV **reduces partisanship** and promotes **candidates with broader appeal** ([FairVote](https://fairvote.org/report/ranked-choice-voting-lowers-polarization-in-politics/)).

## Ranked Choice in 2024 and Beyond
As the U.S. faces increasing polarization and voter dissatisfaction, systems like Ranked Choice Voting offer a path forward. By amplifying voter choice and reducing the dominance of entrenched parties, RCV could help build confidence in democratic institutions and drive voter engagement.
