One of the most exciting aviation developments to look for in 2025 is the adoption of the new **Airbus A321XLR** aircraft variant. While this **Extra Long Range variant** of the standard A321 might not seem revolutionary, the potential impact on smaller markets is immense. To demonstrate let’s take a look at how the A321XLR could impact my home airport, Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU).

## Furthest Range for a Single Aisle Jet
The main distinguishing characteristic of the A321XLR is the **4,700nm range**. That’s **27% further** that the popular existing A321neo model introduced into service in 2017. This gives the A321XLR the **furthest range of any single aisle commercial jet**.

## Impact on Midsize Airports
For midsize airports like RDU, having a medium size aircraft capable of flying across the Atlantic could be a game-changer. Currently, RDU has daily transatlantic service to London, Paris, and Frankfurt on wide-body planes. These are popular destinations that are also major hubs for connecting passengers to other parts of Europe and Asia.
<br>
But, the lower capacity A321XLR could make it **financially viable** for airlines to serve “skinnier” routes to destinations like **Barcelona**, **Munich**, or **Rome**. It could even be used to service South American destinations like **São Paulo**.

## Development and Rollout
The A321XLR was first **announced in 2019** with the **first delivery being made in 2024** to Spanish carrier Iberia Airlines. In the US, both **American** and **United** have orders for 50 of the jets, with **JetBlue** having an additional 13. While the airlines have indicated that they’ll likely **start the planes on longer domestic routes**, there’s no telling what kind of unique international routes could be opened up in the future!
<br>
Technologically, there’s a few key advancements that made this extended range possible. First and foremost, an **additional fuel tank** is installed in the rear of the aircraft, providing additional fuel capacity. Most airlines will opt for a premium-heavy seating configuration, thereby reducing overall seating and extending range further.
<br>
To accommodate the extra fuel weight during takeoff, the plane has a **reinforced landing gear**, as well as a **aerodynamic improvements** like optimized wing flaps.

## Conclusion
Overall, the A321XLR represents an **exciting opportunity for small and medium airports** like RDU. What are your thoughts on the A321XLR? Are there any routes from your home airport that would be good candidates for this plane?
