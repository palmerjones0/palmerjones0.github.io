Inspired by [The Points Guy's article](https://thepointsguy.com/news/breeze-airways-profitable-quarter/), I wanted to reflect on Breeze Airways’ impressive milestone: their **first full quarter of operating profit** in [Q4 2024](https://www.flybreeze.com/news/breeze-airways-announces-first-full-quarter-of-operating-profit-in-4q2024).

This accomplishment stands out as other discount airlines, like Spirit Airlines and JetBlue, [face significant challenges](https://airlineweekly.skift.com/2025/01/the-u-s-airlines-growing-and-shrinking-in-2025/). As a frequent traveler from *Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU)*, my personal experiences with Breeze have been overwhelmingly positive, and I believe their success is in large part down to **three critical strategies**.

## 1. Scaled Sensibly

Breeze took a smart approach to growth by **leasing smaller Embraer 190/195 planes** during their early days. This allowed them to expand to underserved markets quickly while waiting for deliveries of their game-changing **Airbus A220-300s**. These A220s stand out for their fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and operating cost advantages, helping Breeze secure a sustainable edge in the competitive airline industry.

## 2. Leveraged Their Network

David Neeleman, Breeze’s founder and CEO, tapped into his deep aviation expertise and relationships to build a robust operation. For instance, **leasing planes from Azul Brazilian Airlines**, which Neeleman also founded, was a key strategic move that helped to bridge a capacity gap. Moreover, Neeleman recruited [key leaders](https://www.flybreeze.com/page/leadership) from successful competitors, especially Allegiant, which has profitally operated using a similar point-to-point route strategy.

## 3. Kept It Simple

From my perspective, simplicity is where Breeze truly excels. Their **website and app are intuitive**, and their fare bundles are transparent. This eliminates the surprise fees or confusion at the check-in counter that often accompany discount airlines, leading to a calmer, more enjoyable travel experience. Dare I say it's a *breeze?*

Every flight includes **free Wi-Fi**, setting Breeze apart in the budget airline sector. Additionally, their rewards program is straightforward and easy to use—no complex tiers or blackout dates. This commitment to simplicity means passengers board relaxed, and it reflects in the overall vibe of the flights I’ve taken from RDU.

## Looking Ahead

Breeze Airways has set a strong example of how thoughtful strategy and customer-focused operations can lead to profitability, even in challenging times. As someone who flies Breeze regularly from RDU, I am optimistic about their future and look forward to seeing them maintain their success while continuing to deliver exceptional travel experiences.
