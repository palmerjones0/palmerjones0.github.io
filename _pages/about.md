## My Bio

As the sidebar says, I’m a Solutions Architect and Consultant specializing in B2B Supply Chain software and Applied Artificial Intelligence.

I started my Supply Chain career in **Labor Management Consulting** implementing both in-houes and third-party solutions for clients. I found LM to be a great sector for early career development for a few reasons. Since labor accounts for such a large portion or most facility's operating costs, **small increases** in effeciency brought on by an aspiring engineer can have an **outsized impact** on the bottom-line. Given the extensive variability in roles that associates work in different industries, finding solutions that increase efficiency require aptitudes for **creativity** and **iterative problem-solving**. Maybe most importantly, working in Labor Management requires **communicating with all levels of the corporate structure**: from floor associates to VPs and above. I often found that the best ideas came from the floor associaties; my role was to simply **act as a voice** for them and to help find the overlap between their ideas and the constraints of the Warehouse Management System or Enterprise Resource Planning System. Additionally, I greatly enjoyed working as a consultant because it afforded me the opporunity see a myriad of different operating environments, giving me experience with different industries. *Nothing replaces seeing an operation with your own two eyes!*
