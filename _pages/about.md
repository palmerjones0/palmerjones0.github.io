## My Industry Experience

<h3>Application Systems Administrator</h3>

Working with our <b>in-house Labor Management System</b> also afforded me the opportunity to take my passion for programming beyond Excel by working on the technical side of the platform as an <b>Application System Administrator</b>. As our emerging solution gained traction with clients with larger facilities, there arose a <b>pressing need to overhaul our travel mapping algorithm</b> to support sites with thousands of storage locations. After hearing about the growing issue from my fellow associates onsite at a new client's very large facility, I <b>proactively designed and built a solution</b> that incorporated modern pathfinding algorithms while <b>maintaining compatibility</b> with our legacy user interface. The result was an algorithm that produced more accurate travel calculations <b>over 1000 times faster</b> than our existing solution. Bundling the solution into one simple html file made it easy for our associates to use and available when they were offline, a frequent occurance while travelling or at a rural client site. An added benefit of this new logic is it allowed calculations to happen "on the fly" which drastically reduced the storage requirements needed for our servers. This role also allowed me to take <b>ownership of our training process for new teammates</b> that joined our team. Not only did this give me the opportunity to practice effective teaching techniques and technical documentation, it also allowed me to <b>form a connection with every member of our team</b>. I took great pride in being one of the first people others would turn to if they had a question, whether related to my expertise with our software or not. <i>If I don't know the answer, I'll certainly find out who does!</i> Having this close connection was especially important when supporting our largest customer, a <b>Fortune 50 beverage distributor</b> with over 300 North American locations using our software. My experience with this in-house software served as an amazing learning experience and it fueled my desire to pursue my next opportunity outside of consulting with a platform-focused supply chain company.

<h3>Sr. Labor Management Consulant</h3>

I started my Supply Chain career in <b>Labor Management Consulting</b> implementing both in-house and third-party solutions for clients. I found LM to be a great sector for early   career development for a few reasons. Since labor accounts for such a large portion or most facility's operating costs, <b>small increases</b> in effeciency brought on by an aspiring engineer can have an <b>outsized impact</b> on the bottom-line. Given the extensive variability in job functions for floor associates between companies, finding solutions that increase efficiency require aptitudes for <b>creativity</b> and <b>iterative problem-solving</b>. Maybe most importantly, working in Labor Management requires <b>communicating with all levels of the corporate structure</b>: from floor associates to VPs and above. I often found that the best ideas came from the floor associaties; my role was to simply <b>act as a voice</b> for them and to find the overlap between their ideas and the constraints of the Warehouse Management System or Enterprise Resource Planning System. Additionally, I greatly enjoyed working as a consultant because it afforded me the opporunity see a myriad of different operating environments, giving me experiences with different industries. <i>Nothing replaces seeing an operation with your own two eyes!</i>
